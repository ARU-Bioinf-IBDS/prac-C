# Practical C: lists and strings.

## Practical Learning Outcomes

This practical looks at how to work with lists in Python and explores how strings and lists are related. 

By the end of Practical C you will be able to:
* define a Python list
* append items to a list
* find the number of items in a list
* get a specific element from a list using its index
* use list slices to get a subset of a list
* reverse a list
* replace a list element
* delete a list element
* understand the similarities and differences between strings and lists in Python.


## Preparation
To prepare for this practical you should first work through

* *Chapter 2 Python Lists*
* *Chapter 3 Function and Packages*

from the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
online course [Intro to Python for Data Science
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).  
What you have learnt there is then used to explore
how biological sequence data can be handled in Python. We will be concentrating
on how lists can be used and their similarities and differences to 
strings.

## The practical
To use this practical you should *either*:

* If you are using Azure Notebooks import the practical as a library into your Azure Notebooks account,
  by clicking on (and then accepting default options):\
  [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)
  ](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/prac-C/)

* *Or* if you are using Google Colab then:
  * [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) workbook_C.ipynb](
    https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-C/blob/master/workbook_C.ipynb) 
    then *COPY TO DRIVE*.
  * [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) homework_C.ipynb](
    https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-C/blob/master/homework_C.ipynb) 
    then *COPY TO DRIVE*.  

* *Or* if you are using a local Jupyter Notebook installation, then 
  * download [workbook_C.ipynb](
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-C/master/workbook_C.ipynb)
    by right clicking on the link and selecting *"Save Link As"*
  * download [homework_C.ipynb](
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-C/master/homework_C.ipynb)
    by right clicking on the link and selecting *"Save Link As"*

  Once you have downloaded the notebooks move them to a directory where you are
  storing your work for this module (I would advise calling this `IBDS` and placing this in a
  folder that is automatically backed up to OneDrive, GoogleDrive or similar). 

If this unfamiliar, please go back and look at 
  [Practical A](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-A) 


Then in Azure Notebooks or Jupyter Notebook:
* open the workbook **workbook_C.ipynb** and work through it.
* once you have completed the workbook, then move onto the homework book **homework_C.ipynb**
* then go on to [Reflection on Practical C: lists and strings](
  https://canvas.anglia.ac.uk/courses/1490/discussion_topics/54039).
