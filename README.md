# Practical C: lists and strings.

## Practical Learning Outcomes

This practical looks at how to work with lists in Python and explores how strings and lists are related. 

By the end of Practical C you will be able to:
* define a Python list
* append items to a list
* find the number of items in a list
* get a specific element from a list using its index
* use list slices to get a subset of a list
* reverse a list
* replace a list element
* delete a list element
* understand the similarities and differences between strings and lists in Python.


## Preparation
To prepare for this practical you should first work through

* *Chapter 2 Python Lists*
* *Chapter 3 Function and Packages*

from the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
online course [Intro to Python for Data Science
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).  
What you have learnt there is then used to explore
how biological sequence data can be handled in Python. We will be concentrating
on how lists can be used and their similarities and differences to 
strings.

## The practical
To use this practical you should either:

* Import the exercise as a library into your Azure Notebooks account,
  by clicking on: 

  [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)
  ](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-ex-B/)

  If this unfamiliar, please review: 
  [Getting Started Instructions using Azure Notebooks
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro#getting-started-instructions-using-azure-notebooks).

* or if you are using a local Jupyter Notebook installation, then 
  download:

  [<img src="images/download_zip.png" alt="Download zip" width="50px"/>
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-ex-B/archive/master.zip)

  then unzip the file and move the directory to where you are storing your work.
  If this unfamiliar, please review: 
  [Getting Started Instructions using local Jupyter Notebook installation
  ](https://github.com/ARU-Bioinformatics/ibdsA-intro#getting-started-instructions-using-local-jupyter-notebook-installation).

Then in Azure Notebooks or Jupyter Notebook:
* open the workbook **workbook_C.ipynb** and work through it.
* once you have completed the workbook, then move onto the homework book **homework_C.ipynb**
* we will go through everyones completed notebook in *Seminar B*.
